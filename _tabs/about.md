## `whoami`

I am a passionate French **Cybersecurity Engineer** dedicated to ensuring the safety of the digital world (well, it's complicated...) \
My work involves DFIR, CTI, fortifying defenses, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing good security measures to protect against threats.

## Open Source Contributions

One of my key projects is [Cyberbro](https://github.com/stanfrbd/cyberbro). \
I'm actively working on this personal open-source project, which aims to enhance IoC analysis. \
Your contributions and feedback are more than welcome!

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussions about cybersecurity, open source projects, or anything tech-related 💬. \
Feel free to reach out and start a conversation! Here's my LinkedIn attached for professional purpose.

## Favorite Programming Language

My go-to language for most of my projects is **Python** 🐍. \
Most cybersecurity people can contribute using Python, and even if it's not the most optimized language, it just works!
